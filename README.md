# Phishing Spammer
a PHP-based tool to fight phishing sites

It's made to make scammers "work" more difficult ;)

It's a pre-alfa version becouse I don't have much time.

**STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION!**

## Get started
Upload the repo code to online host supporting PHP and curl.

## Config
You can config Phishing Bomber with JSON files (credentials.json and proxy.json).
